Linear detection is crucial for tasks in computer vision. While Relationformer has advanced in inter-object relationship modeling, it struggles with endpoint prediction and matching stability. To solve these issues, we plan to reproduce and validate Relationformer. And then we will propose a distance-weighted approach, which replaces the Dirac delta distribution to enhance endpoint localization. Moreover, inspired by General Focal Loss, we will mitigate errors arising from negative samples.
