We propose to develop a deep learning-based classifier for early autism screening
by analyzing video recordings of childrenâ€™s behavior and gaze. By leveraging transfer
learning from pre-trained visual models and integrating temporal modeling techniques,
our approach aims to provide a robust probability estimate of Autism Spectrum Disor-
der (ASD) from standard video recordings. This project has the potential to improve
early screening accuracy while using accessible, low-cost hardware.
